# The Cinemax Daily Report
IBOPE is the linear TV ratings vendor for Latin America. This report provides an overview of Cinemax performance by day, benchmarked against the previous 5 weeks. 
In order to obtain all the KPIs needed to complete this report it needs to intake minute-by-minute data for every channel available and scheduling information for Cinemax.

# Motivation
At the moment, the Cinemax Research team runs this report as a spreadsheet. As such, it takes a long time to process and itâ€™s sometimes unstable due to the presence of array and indirect formulas.
The first step in automation for these reports is going to be abstracting all data processing from the spreadsheet and leveraging the efficiencies of pivot tables to update charts with a single click. These reports will still be delivered as a pdf so we will continue to use the spreadsheets as a reporting tool
